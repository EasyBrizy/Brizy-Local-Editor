# Introduction

Before you start planning and developing your Brizy widget, it’s important to understand what widgets are and how they fit into Brizy.
Widgets are a way third party developers can extend the Brizy’s functionality, add new features, integrate external services, customize workflow and more.

## Widget Opportunities

The potential for creating new widgets is almost limitless.
Developers can explore advanced widgets, form integrations, dynamic tags, animations, lead collection extensions,
custom fonts and font icons, complex sliders, mega menus, visibility features, and beyond.
