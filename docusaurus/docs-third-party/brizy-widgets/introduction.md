# Introduction

Before you start planning and developing your Brizy addon, it’s important to understand what addons are and how they fit into Brizy. 
Addons are a way third party developers can extend the Brizy’s functionality, add new features, integrate external services, customize workflow and more.

## Addon Opportunities
The potential for creating new addons is almost limitless. 
Developers can explore advanced widgets, form integrations, dynamic tags, animations, lead collection extensions, 
custom fonts and font icons, complex sliders, mega menus, visibility features, and beyond.
