# Deployment

`npm run build` creates a build directory with a production build of your app. 
Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static paths like /static/js/main.js are served with the contents of the /static/js/main.js file. 
For more information see the production build section.
