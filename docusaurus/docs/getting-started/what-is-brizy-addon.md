# What is an Brizy addon?

Before embarking on Brizy addon creation, it's crucial to grasp the nature and role of addons within the Brizy ecosystem. <br/>
Brizy addons are custom-built extensions that enhance Brizy's core functionality. Brizy provide a platform for developers to introduce new widgets, new features, integrate external services, and tailor the platform to specific user needs.

## Process
In the process of developing an addon, the developer is able to create a new widget in which he can customize:
<ul>
  <li>Toolbar - the controls displayed in the toolbar.</li>
  <li>Sidebar - the controls displayed in the sidebar.</li>
  <li>Dynamic Content - defining controls for dynamic data</li>
  <li>Defaults - the default values for controls</li>
  <li>CSS - dynamic styling based on control values</li>
</ul>
