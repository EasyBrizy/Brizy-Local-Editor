# Introduction

Brizy widgets are essentially JavaScript and CSS packages that extend the builder's capabilities with new elements, features, or functionalities.
A solid foundation in TypeScript, CSS, React, and npm is essential for widget development, as these technologies underpin the widget's structure, functionality, user interface, and integration with the Brizy platform.

To effectively create Brizy widgets, developers must be proficient in utilizing these technologies to build robust, user-friendly, and performant extensions that seamlessly complement the core Brizy builder experience.

## Process

In the process of developing an widget, the developer is able to create a new widget in which he can customize:

<ul>
  <li>[Toolbar](/docs-internals/brizy-editor/introduction) - the controls displayed in the toolbar.</li>
  <li>[Sidebar](/docs-internals/brizy-editor/introduction) - the controls displayed in the sidebar.</li>
  <li>[Dynamic Content](/docs-internals/control-arguments/dynamic-content) - defining controls for dynamic data</li>
  <li>[Defaults](/docs-internals/control-arguments/defaults) - the default values for controls</li>
  <li>[CSS](/docs-internals/control-arguments/css) - dynamic styling based on control values</li>
</ul>

## Brizy Core

Brizy has matured into a robust platform that provides a foundation for third-party extensions to address niche market requirements and expand core functionalities. While some developers have focused on specialized features, others have reimagined existing components and integrated innovative capabilities.
