# Introduction

Brizy widgets are essentially JavaScript and CSS packages that extend the builder's capabilities with new elements, features, or functionalities.
A solid foundation in TypeScript, CSS, React, and npm is essential for widget development, as these technologies underpin the widget's structure, functionality, user interface, and integration with the Brizy platform.

To effectively create Brizy widgets, developers must be proficient in utilizing these technologies to build robust, user-friendly, and performant extensions that seamlessly complement the core Brizy builder experience.
